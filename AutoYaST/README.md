# SUSE Multi-Linux Manager and Uyuni AutoYaST Profiles

This directory contains example profiles for AutoYaST for both SUSE Multi-Linux Manager (formerly SUSE Manager) and the upstream Uyuni project.

**IMPORTANT: SELECT YOUR PRODUCT AND VERSION**

Due to recent client channel re-branding and version updates, it is crucial that you use the profiles from the correct top-level directory.

Navigate to the directory that matches your server and version:

* ### **`Uyuni/`**
    Profiles for **all versions of the upstream Uyuni project**. These profiles follow Uyuni's specific channel constraints and naming conventions.

* ### **`SUSE-Multi-Linux-Manager/`**
    Profiles for **SUSE Multi-Linux Manager version 5.1 and any newer major release**. Use this directory if you are working with the **new, re-branded client tools channels**. These profiles can't be used with SUSE Manager 5.0 and older.

* ### **`SUSE-Manager-Legacy/`**
    Legacy profiles for **SUSE Manager 5.0 and all older versions**. These profiles are compatible with the **legacy client tools channels** . They are compatible with SUSE Multi-Linux Manager 5.1 as well, but typically should not be needed.
